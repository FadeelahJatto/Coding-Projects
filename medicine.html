            Orthopedic surgery or orthopedics (alternatively spelt orthopaedics),
            is the branch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery">surgery</a> concerned with conditions
            involving
            the musculoskeletal system.

            Orthopedic surgeons use both <span>surgical</span> &amp; <span>nonsurgical</span> means to treat
            musculoskeletal
            trauma, spine diseases,
            sports injuries, degenerative diseases, infections, tumors, and congenital disorders.

            <h2>Training</h2>
            <p>In the United States, orthopedic surgeons have typically completed four years of undergraduate education
                and
                four
                years of medical school and earned either a Doctor of Medicine (MD) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine
                (DO)
                degree. Subsequently, these medical school graduates undergo residency training in orthopedic surgery.
                The
                five-year residency is a categorical orthopedic surgery training.
                Selection for residency training in orthopedic surgery is very competitive. Roughly 700 physicians
                complete
                orthopedic residency training per year in the United States. About 10% of current orthopedic surgery
                residents
                are women; about 20% are members of minority groups. Around 20,400 actively practicing orthopedic
                surgeons
                and
                residents are in the United States.<sup>[18]</sup> According to the latest Occupational Outlook Handbook
                published by the United States Department of Labor, 3 to 4% of all practicing physicians are orthopedic
                surgeons.
                Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further training, or fellowships, after completing their residency
                training. Fellowship training in an orthopedic sub-specialty is typically one year in duration
                (sometimes
                two)
                and sometimes has a research component involved with the clinical and operative training.</p>
